# sendanor/ib

Shell client for [Sendanor's Inventory Backend (for Ansible)](https://github.com/sendanor/inventory-backend).

You could also think of it as a simple REST client for shell scripts and command line.

### Development Status

The project currently is [actively developed](https://github.com/sendanor/ib/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open).

This is an unstable development version.

The first stable release is expected to arrive later 2020/12.

### Commercial Support

Commercial support up to 10 years is available from [Sendanor](https://sendanor.com).

We will increase the price 10% weekly after [weekly milestone is completed](https://github.com/sendanor/ib/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open).

Finnish customers can purchase the support plan from [our webstore](https://nor.fi/ansible). Please [contact us](https://sendanor.com), if you would like to purchase the plan from outside of Finland.
